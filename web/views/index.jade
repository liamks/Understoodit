      h3 The Problem
      p During lectures itâ€™s difficult for every student to let you know they understand. Especially in large classes, many students are reluctant to express their confusion which limits both their learning and their enjoyment.

    div.col.span6
      h3 The Solution
      p Understoodit addresses this issue by allowing students to anonymously, and in real-time, indicate if they understand or are confused. Understoodit runs on devices that you and your students already own: smartphones, tablets, netbooks and notebooks.

      h3 For Teachers
      p Why wait until evaluations at the end of the term to find out if your students were confused With understoodit, you get feedback in real-time allowing you to make changes during your lecture to help students understand difficult topics.

    div.col.span6
      h3 For Students
      p Understoodit allows you to anonymously, and democratically, inform the professor that you're either confused or you understand. Giving your professors feedback allows them to improve their teaching, and your learning.
